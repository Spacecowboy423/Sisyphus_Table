        title: "About the Builder",
        content:
            "I'm Michael Krause, a student and professional engineer who's passionate about combining technology and craftsmanship. This Sisyphus table project allowed me to merge my interests in electronics, programming, and woodworking into one incredible build.",

        title: "Why Build a Sisyphus Table?",
        content:
            "I've been fascinated by kinetic art sand tables ever since I discovered Bruce Shapiro's Sisyphus table. I knew I had to build one myself to really test my skills and flex my creativity. It's the perfect intersection of art, engineering, and functionality.",
    },
    {
        title: "Skills Gained",
        content:
            "This project taught me so much on things I've never done before and let me hone my skills on things I am familiar with. Motor control systems, precision woodworking, programming pattern generation algorithms, electronics assembly, and problem-solving when things didn't work as planned. Every challenge became an incredible learning opportunity.",
    },
    {
        title: "The Challenge",
        content:
            "The biggest challenge, beyond coding the entire movement system, was getting the mechanics perfectly smooth and precise. The magnet needs to move with exact positioning to create clean patterns in the sand, but the pull between the magnet and the steel ball needs to be precise to ensure it can move through the sand smoothly without losing contact or grinding on the table. Fine-tuning the motor speeds, acceleration curves, and pattern code took weeks of trial and error. But the end result has been more than worth it!",
